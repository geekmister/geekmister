I'm Geekmister, it's my nickname 😊! Why am i called that? Because I adore the geek spirit, the power to change the world when you move your fingertips 🖐️! 

I majored in computer technology at university and I like it very much 😍. After graduation, I have been engaged in the computer technology industry for ten years, during which I trained myself as a full-stack development engineer. ✊

Since I registered my github account 10 years ago, I haven't used it very often. In the second decade of my career, I want to put my technology sharing on github! Welcome to follow me! 👍

Then you can learn more about me through the following content... 👇
